# Getting and cleaning data course project
This is is repository created for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project

The steps of the project are 

* Downloading data

* Writing a code called run_analysis.R to clean data

* Generate a tidy data set using the code

## Data description 

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

## Code descrption

The code performs the following tasks as required in the project assignment

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Tidy data set

A tidy data set has been created using the code above.
